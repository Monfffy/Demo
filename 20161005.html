<p>Still thinking about the interview last night even after a long night sleep (maybe not that because I cannot fall asleep till late). 
Still feel that excitement to hear all the possibilities in U.S.
People may change their dream, but will never loss the ability to dream. 
So good to feel young and do something for what you want.</p>
<p>Maybe it is turly what people said about dream land. I'm not regret even if it's not. I'll find out. =D</p>
