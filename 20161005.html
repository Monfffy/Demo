<p>Still thinking about the interview last night even after a long night sleep (maybe not that long because I cannot fall asleep till quite late). 
Still feel that excitement to hear all the possibilities in US.
People may change their dreams, but should never loss the ability to dream. 
So good to feel in this way, to feel the touch of dream.</p>
<p>Maybe it is turly what people said about dream land. I'm not regret even if it's not. I'll find out. =D</p>
