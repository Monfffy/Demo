<p>Just feel a lttle bit tired and upset this morning when dealing with this room and clearing all my staff alone, feel like moving away and suddenly understand what does that means by Chuyao that "You never live in the living room." And why I need to struggle for all those and even travel fee. I don't have to, really.</p>
<p>People are sometimes shallow and there is nothing wrong, is it? Because I am, sometimes.</p>
