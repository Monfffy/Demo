<p>There are some moments in the life that you suddenly come up with something that you want to do, without any meaningful benefits.That's called emotional I guess.Like this website, like thinking about why people change, or even why yourself change.</p>
<p>I never want to deny I am kind of selfish people that care about myself more than others. But I believe that is the right way for anyone and you should do it too.
I mean you do need to consider me above you, and I don't want any sacrifice come from whoever, especially you. If you have made up your mind, I'm really happy for you. There is nothing to blame in the first place.</p>
<p>I still remember that person who said he wants to travel around the world with that shinning eyes and I still love that person even I know there are lots of things changed between us since we graduate. We did some damage to each other and run away from unsecurity. But at least we still hold that faith even with fear. We can't deny we have changed, from young to mature; from careless to care.</p>
